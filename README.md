*I am submitting :*

- a README.md file (this file)
- a run_analysis.R file (this contains the actual codes)
- a CodeBook.md file (which describes the variable names and variable transformations)

*My run_analysis.R :*


- Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.

- Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement.

- Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set

- Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names.

- From the data set in the step above, creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.
